            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And firſt I am to aſſure you of His Majeſties conſtant and unalterable Zeal, for maintaining and defending the true refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Proteſtant Religion in this His Kingdom, for which he will conſtantly lay out His whole Power and Authority, as alſo for diſcouraging and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Atheiſm and Profanities, and all that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

                  <p>In the next Place, I am commanded to let you know, That I am ſufficiently Inſtructed to give His Majeſties Royal Aſſent to ſuch Laws as ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in this Parliament, for the conſtant Peace and welfare of this Church, and of the Kingdom in all its Relations: But the chief Occaſion of calling this Parliament, is the proſecution of that great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Deſign of bringing His Kingdoms of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> to a ſtricter and nearer Union. This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was begun by His Royal Grandfather of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Memory, who went ſo far on towards this great Work, that in the firſt year of His Reign over Great Britain, King <hi>James</hi> named Commiſſioners for this Kingdom, who by Act of Parliament were authorized to Treat and Conſult with Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> concerning ſuch an Union: And in purſuance of their Treaty, Acts were made for the Repealing of Hoſtile Laws, and the utter abolition of all memory of Hoſtility between the two Nations: And in the Seventh year of His Raign, it was, by the Judges of all the Courts of <hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall in <hi>England,</hi> ſolemnly adjudged, in the Caſe of the <hi>Post-nati,</hi> that thoſe who after the Deſcent of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to King

And the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of His Majeſties Reſolutions to proſecute this great Work, were theſe, Complaints having been made to His Majeſty, That ſince the 25th day of <hi>March,</hi> in the Twelfth year of His Reign, new duties were impoſed in <hi>England,</hi> upon divers Commodities of the growth, production, and manufacture of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and incapacities laid upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Scotland:</hi> It pleaſed the King to appoint divers Meetings upon this Matter, though without Succeſs: whereupon the late Parliament of this Kingdom impoſed, in their third Seſſion <hi>Ann.</hi> 1663. great Duties upon the Commodities of the growth, production or manufacture of <hi>England,</hi> which by His Majeſties Command were ſuſpended, and have not been exacted, though the Duties in <hi>England</hi> ſtill continue; and upon His Majeſties recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> an Act was lately made for ſetling freedom and intercourſe of Trade between the two Kingdomes: Whereupon Commiſſioners were nominated and appointed by His Majeſty for both Kingdoms to Treat upon that Affair, who had many Meetings, but produced no effect, unleſs it were a conviction of the Difficulty, if not impoſſibility of ſetling it in any other way, then by a nearer and more compleat Union of the two Kingdoms. His Majeſty is fully perſwaded that nothing can tend more to the good and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of both Nations, than ſuch an Union. And find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in His Royal Grandfathers time, ſo great an advance was made towards this Union, and that the continuance under the ſame Obedience for near 70. years, having begotten the ſame common Friends

His Majeſty well hopes, that what is yet wanting to the perfecting of it, may be now accompliſh'd, And therefore, in His Majeſties Name, I do moſt heartily recommend this great work unto you; and I doubt not, but you will ſpeedily ſend ſuch an humble Anſwer to His Majeſties moſt gracious Letter, as may witneſs how well grounded that Confidence is, which His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty hath expreſſed of you. This day the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> meets, and the King will both Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and by His Lord Keeper make the like Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals (as to the Union) unto both Houſes: And I am confident, that Loyal Parliament, who have all along given ſuch ample Teſtimonies of their Duty and Affection to His Majeſty, will upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion make a ſuitable Return to His Propoſals. What is farther to be propoſed upon this Matter, ſhall be offered at your next dayes Meeting: and the King doubts not but that after the meeting of Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for both Kingdoms, thoſe things will be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to your conſideration, in order to the Union, as ſhall tend to the Honour of His Majeſty, and the common good of all His Subjects. Theſe things I was commanded, before I came away from His Majeſty to acquaint you with, and I have ſince, upon another Occaſion, received an order in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, bearing date the 7th of this Moneth; by which I am again commanded, amply to declare His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties unchangable Reſolution to maintain <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Government in the Church. So having begun and ended with this Declaration, I hope both the groundleſs Jealouſies, on the one hand, and the vain and idle hopes on the other ſhall be at an end.</p>
